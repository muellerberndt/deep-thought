# DEEP-THOUGHT: A self-referential, category-theoretic model of reality

DEEP-THOUGHT is a proposal for how reality can arise from nothing but a single act of self-reference.

DEEP-THOUGHT begins from the most minimal possible starting point: 
a single distinction — the recognition that one thing is not another —  
and the act of relating that thing to itself.  
This is the only precondition: *relation* as a primitive.

From there, the Universe evolves by a single principle:  
**meaning is assigned when one part of the network of relations changes in the context of others**.  
Each new relation adds structure to the whole, changing the “meaning” of everything already present.  
Over time, these assignments of meaning build an ever-richer self-referential network.

The mathematical core is the **free symmetric monoidal dagger-compact category** on one object.  
Morphisms are built from identities, symmetries, cups, caps, composition, and tensor product; the dagger is diagrammatic reflection.  
Dynamics proceeds by applying a local transformation to the current diagram and feeding part of the output back into its input via the categorical trace, ensuring self-reference at every stage.

This project is in active development. The current working paper can be found [here](https://github.com/muellerberndt/deep-thought/blob/main/paper/DEEP_THOUGHT_v0.1.pdf).

## Minimal assumptions

1. **Self-reference**  
   The initial state is the identity morphism on the generating object: a loop relating to itself.

2. **Relations as primitives**  
   Objects have no intrinsic attributes; all meaning comes from morphisms.

3. **Evolution by feedback**  
   The update rule is  
   \[
   D_{t+1} = \mathrm{Tr}_X\!\left(K_t\circ(D_t\otimes 1_X)\right),
   \]
   with \(K_t\) chosen to optimise symmetry, integration \((\Phi)\), and entropy.

## Emergent physics

The same growth and optimisation scheme accounts for key features of our Universe:

| Phenomenon | Mechanism in DEEP-THOUGHT | Status |
|------------|---------------------------|--------|
| **3 + 1 spacetime** | Spectral dimension of the interaction graph stabilises at \(d_s\approx 3\); trace direction provides time ordering. | derived |
| **Standard Model gauge groups** | Stable valences 1, 2, 3 give local automorphism groups U(1), SU(2), SU(3). | derived |
| **Three fermion families** | CP-violation requires ≥3; entropy penalises more; optimisation picks exactly three. | derived |
| **Arrow of time** | Local reversibility from the dagger, global irreversibility from entropy growth. | qualitative |
| **Dark-matter-like effects** | Curvature in relational geometry mimics unseen mass; predicts lensing–entropy correlation. | testable |
| **No fourth fermion family** | Higher generations fail optimisation; absence is a prediction. | testable |
| **Primordial GW feature** | First global oscillation mode redshifted to nHz band; predicts a break in PTA spectra. | testable |

## Why this matters

- **Unifies** spacetime, matter, and observers in a single generative rule.
- **Derives** structural features normally taken as axioms.
- **Predicts** observational signatures in gravitational waves, lensing, and particle content.
- **Falsifiable**: failure of any key prediction forces revision.
